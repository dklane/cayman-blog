<h2>Welcome to Intro To Programming!</h2>
<p>This class will provide an introduction to programming for the web.</p>
<p>We will start with a brief introduction to the C programming language and VEX robotics. C is one of the older computer&nbsp;languages but is still used in most high-performance applications. These applications include most operating systems, embedded microcontrollers, and our VEX robots. We use these robots to compete in an international competition at&nbsp;BSHS. I want you to know how they work and hope you will consider joining one of our VEX teams.</p>
<p>Many programming languages are used in web development. Three foundational languages are HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We will learn the syntax of these languages using resources on CodeHS. Once you become familiar with these languages, we will pause for projects that allow you to apply these skills. I will also introduce you to live web development and revision control using GitHub.</p>
<p>The next step in this course is to study Python. This is a high-level scripting language that is used by many developers. Python is a relatively new that language that was designed for simplicity and benefited from the languages that proceeded it. Python is often used on web&nbsp;servers, software testing frameworks, and user applications.</p>
<p>We may also choose to study sections of the following&nbsp;books:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python Crash Course</li>
<li>Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python</li>
</ul>
<p>If we complete all these resources, there are numerous topics we can study, For example, I am investigating educational resources that were recently released by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/14-and-older/">Amazon Web Services</a>.</p>
<p>This class offers a great opportunity to attempt industry certifications. Your computer programming pathway&nbsp;gives credit for certifications in HTML, Javascript, and Python.</p>
