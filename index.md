It is an honor to work with the staff and students at Bryan Station. 
After working at IBM, Lexmark, and Mathworks, I am pleased to return to Bryan Station as a teacher and alumni. 
Our school has many excellent programs and I am excited to be part of the
<a href="https://www.fcps.net/domain/5384">Information Technology Academy</a>.

My [courses for 2018-19](courses) include 
[Computer Literacy](complit),
[Computational Thinking](compthink),
[Introduction to Programming](introprog),
and [Java](java). 
I expect the students in these courses to learn useful skills
and earn [industry certifications](certifications).
