<h2>Welcome to Computer Literacy!</h2>
<p>This class will provide information about computer hardware, typing skills, and the Office 2016 suite.</p>
<p>A key goal of this class is to prepare you for industry certifications. Completion of these will be part of your final in this class. You will be expected to pass the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/mos-certification.aspx">Microsoft Office Specialist (MOS) Certifications</a>&nbsp;for Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. We will study Access as time permits and you are welcome to attempt the MOS certification for Access.</p>
<p>Before jumping into these Microsoft Office applications, we will study the basics of computer hardware and practice our typing skills. This is valuable information and also part of a larger goal. Students who pass the MOS certifications for Word, PowerPoint, and Excel may have the opportunity to earn an&nbsp;<a href="https://certiport.pearsonvue.com/Certifications/IC3/Digital-Literacy-Certification/Overview">IC3 Digital Literacy Certification</a>. We are seeking access to the required review/testing resources for this certification. The&nbsp;<a href="https://certiport.pearsonvue.com/Certifications/IC3/Digital-Literacy-Certification/Certify/IC3-Global-Standard-5">IC3 Global Standard 5</a> certification has three components:&nbsp;Computing Fundamentals, Living Online, and Key Applications. Numerous students passed the MOS certifications last year but we were not able to offer them the IC3 exams.</p>
<p>We will also include an overview of the Google suite: Docs, Slides, and Sheets. The IC3 exam expects students to be familiar with the office suites from Microsoft and Google. This is wise because many people are expected to use both suites in the professional workforce.</p>
<p>Most of you have used portions of the Microsoft and Google suites but I guarantee you will learn new skills in this class. I have used these applications for many years and learned a lot while teaching this class. I hope you will feel the same at the end of this year.</p>
