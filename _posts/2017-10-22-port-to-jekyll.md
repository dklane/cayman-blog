title: "Port from WordPress to Jekyll"
---

Ported this web site from <http://blogs.fcps.net/lane>.

This provided an opportunity to learn about [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) and 
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). 
Another motivation is that load times on our WordPress server can be over 10 seconds. 
Google's performance model, [RAIL](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rail), 
recommends keeping load times below 1 second.

I started with a fork of [Cayman's theme
for Jekyll](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman).
This was faster than starting from an empty GitHub repsoitory.
