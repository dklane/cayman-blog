Computational Thinking is course number 110251 in the 
<a href="https://education.ky.gov/CTE/ctepa/Documents/IT--2017-2018.pdf">IT Program of Studies</a>. 
Its location in the Computer Programming pathway is described on page 8 and 
the course description is on page 32.

We are using resources from the <a href="https://ap.cs50.net">CS50</a> program at 
<a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu">Harvard</a>. 
This curriculum involves programming in several different languages as a vehicle to introduce 
the topics of algorithms, abstraction, data, global impact, and internet technologies.

I also hope to include resources from the following:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://code.org/educate/csd">CS Discoveries</a> from 
 	<a href="https://code.org">code.org</a></li>
 	<li><a href="http://bjc.berkeley.edu">Beauty and Joy of Computing</a> from 
 	<a href="http://www.berkeley.edu">Berkley</a></li>
</ul>
