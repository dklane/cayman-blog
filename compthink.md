<h2>Welcome to Computational&nbsp;Thinking!</h2>
<p>This class is an introductory<span> computer science course</span>.</p>
<p>We will start with a brief introduction to the C programming language and VEX robotics. C is one of the older computer&nbsp;languages but is still used in many high-performance applications. These applications include operating systems, embedded microcontrollers, and our VEX robots. We use these robots to compete in an international competition at&nbsp;BSHS. I want you to know how they work and hope you will consider joining one of our VEX teams.</p>
<p>Most of our time will be focussed on the&nbsp;<a href="https://code.org/educate/csd">Computer Science Discoveries (CSD)</a> resources from "<a href="https://code.org">code.org</a>".&nbsp;<span>CSD is an introductory computer science course that empowers students to create authentic artifacts and engage with computer science as a medium for creativity, communication, problem-solving, and fun. The curriculum covers problem-solving, web development, animations and games, the design process, data and society, and physical computing.</span></p>
<p>I plan to augment the unit on games with a 2D game design tool called <a href="https://www.clickteam.com/clickteam-fusion-2-5">ClickTeam Fusion</a>. We enjoyed using this tool last year. Fusion offers excellent tutorials and produces high-quality&nbsp;games.</p>
<p>We will also use our Arduino kits from <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sik-experiment-guide-for-the-arduino-101genuino-101-board">Sparkfun</a> and <a href="https://www.parallax.com/product/32335">Parallax</a> to further explore physical computing.</p>
<p>If we complete all these resources, there are numerous topics we can study. For example, we could continue our study of HTML and Javascript. I am also investigating educational resources that were recently released by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/14-and-older/">Amazon Web Services</a>.</p>
