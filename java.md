Intro to Programming is course number110201 in the 
<a href="https://education.ky.gov/CTE/ctepa/Documents/IT--2017-2019.pdf">IT Program of Studies</a>. 
Its location in the Computer Programming pathway is described on page 8 and the course 
description is on page 58.

We are using curriculum resources from 
<a href="https://naf.org/">NAF</a>. 
Bryan Station is <a href="https://naf.org/naf-network/find-an-academy">one of seven NAF academies in KY</a>.

We are using the <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> programming language while emphasizing 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">agile design methodology</a>, 
pair programming, and <a href="https://github.com/features">revision control systems</a>. 
I hope to also include portions of the 
<a href="https://nicerc.org/curricula/computer-science/">NICERC</a> curriculum.
